# LanguageTool Offset Bug Fix - Lessons Learned

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ SOLVED
**Difficulty:** Very High
**Time Spent:** ~6 hours across multiple sessions

---

## The Problem

LanguageTool error markers appeared at **incorrect positions** in the editor, especially in:
- Bullet lists (off by 2 characters)
- Nested bullet lists (off by 4 characters)
- Blockquotes (off by 1 character)
- Normal text worked correctly

### Root Cause

**Mismatch between three different coordinate systems:**

1. **LanguageTool API**: Returns 0-based character offsets for the text we send it
2. **getText() output**: Plain text without markdown formatting syntax (`- `, `> `, etc.)
3. **ProseMirror positions**: 1-based tree positions that include node boundaries

**The critical issue:**
- We send plain text (via `getText()`) to LanguageTool → correct for grammar checking
- LanguageTool returns offsets for THIS plain text → correct offsets for what we sent
- BUT when mapping back to editor positions, markdown formatting syntax like `- ` and `> ` exists in the ProseMirror tree but NOT in the plain text
- Result: Positions are off by 2-4 chars depending on formatting type

---

## Why Previous Approaches Failed

### ❌ Attempt 1: Using getMarkdown() instead of getText()
- **Problem**: LanguageTool would see markdown syntax and flag it as errors
- **Example**: `- This is a list` → LanguageTool flags "- This" as grammar issue
- **Outcome**: Creates false positives, unusable

### ❌ Attempt 2: Stripping frontmatter offset
- **Problem**: Document had no frontmatter, so this was irrelevant
- **Outcome**: No effect on the bug

### ❌ Attempt 3: Detecting format from getMarkdown() line content
- **Problem**: TipTap's getMarkdown() doesn't include `- ` at start of bullet lines!
- **Explanation**: The bullet syntax is stored in the tree structure, not as text prefix
- **Outcome**: Cannot detect bullets this way

### ❌ Attempt 4: Complex position mapping with descendants()
- **Problem**: Overcomplicated, tried to map every text position to doc position
- **Outcome**: Made everything worse, completely misaligned

---

## The Solution (What Actually Works)

### Core Approach

**Use ProseMirror's document tree structure to detect formatting type:**

```javascript
// 1. Send plain text to LanguageTool (no markdown syntax)
const text = currentEditor.getText();
const matches = await checkText(text, language);

// 2. For each error, use tree structure to detect formatting
const $pos = currentEditor.state.doc.resolve(approxDocPos);

// 3. Walk up ancestor chain to find listItem or blockquote nodes
for (let d = $pos.depth; d > 0; d--) {
  const node = $pos.node(d);

  if (node.type.name === 'listItem') {
    // Count nesting level by counting bulletList ancestors
    let listDepth = countBulletListAncestors($pos, d);

    if (listDepth === 1) correction = -2;  // First level
    else if (listDepth >= 2) correction = -4;  // Second+ level
  }
  else if (node.type.name === 'blockquote') {
    correction = -1;
  }
}

// 4. Apply correction
const editorPos = textPos + correction + 1; // +1 for doc-start node
```

### Correction Values (Empirically Determined)

| Format Type | Correction | Reason |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Normal text | `0` | No markdown syntax |
| First-level bullet | `-2` | Accounts for `- ` (2 chars) |
| Second-level bullet | `-4` | Accounts for `  - ` (4 chars: 2 spaces + `- `) |
| Blockquote | `-1` | Accounts for `> ` (space behavior differs) |

### Why This Is The ONLY Approach That Works

1. **Plain text to LanguageTool**: Avoids false positives on markdown syntax
2. **Tree structure for detection**: Only way to know if position is in a list/blockquote
3. **Empirical corrections**: Values determined through actual testing, not theoretical calculation
4. **ProseMirror +1**: Account for implicit doc-start node in position system

## Implementation Details

### File: `renderer/app.js`

**Lines ~1149-1223**: Critical fix with comprehensive comments

**Key functions:**
- `currentEditor.getText()` → Get plain text for LanguageTool
- `currentEditor.state.doc.resolve(pos)` → Get resolved position in tree
- `$pos.node(depth)` → Access ancestor nodes
- `$pos.depth` → Get nesting depth in tree

### Testing Process

1. Load document with mixed formatting (normal text, bullets, nested bullets, blockquotes)
2. Insert intentional typos in each format type
3. Click "Scan" and verify error markers appear at correct positions
4. Adjust correction values until all markers align perfectly

## Key Learnings

### 1. Understanding The Coordinate Systems

- **Text offsets** (LanguageTool): Simple character positions in a string
- **ProseMirror positions**: Complex tree-based system with node boundaries
- **The gap**: Markdown formatting syntax exists in tree but not in text

### 2. Why Markdown Detection Fails

TipTap's `getMarkdown()` returns:
```
Normal text

List item content
Another list item
```

NOT:
```
Normal text

- List item content
- Another list item
```

The `- ` syntax is **implicit in the tree structure**, not explicit in text!

### 3. Empirical vs Theoretical

- Initially tried to calculate offsets theoretically → failed
- Switched to empirical testing: apply correction, test, adjust → success
- **Lesson**: Sometimes you need to measure, not calculate

### 4. Debugging Strategy

**What worked:**
- Console.log actual positions and corrections
- Compare expected vs actual marker placement visually
- Test with simple cases first (single bullet) then complex (nested)

**What didn't work:**
- Reading ProseMirror docs to find "the right way"
- Trying to understand the full offset calculation
- Over-engineering the solution

## Future Considerations

### If More Formatting Types Have Offset Issues:

1. Add logging to detect the pattern:
   ```javascript
   console.log(`Node type: ${node.type.name}, offset mismatch: ${expected - actual}`);
   ```

2. Add correction in the same location (renderer/app.js:~1190):
   ```javascript
   else if (node.type.name === 'codeBlock') {
     correction = -3; // Or whatever testing reveals
   }
   ```

3. Test thoroughly before committing

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Ordered lists**: May need different correction (not yet implemented)
- **Nested blockquotes**: May compound the -1 correction
- **Mixed formatting**: List inside blockquote, etc.

**Resolution**: Implement when users report issues, using same empirical approach

---

## Conclusion

This bug took multiple approaches and several hours to solve because:

1. The problem involves THREE different coordinate systems
2. TipTap/ProseMirror's architecture is non-obvious
3. Documentation doesn't cover this specific use case
4. The solution requires empirical testing, not just theory

**The fix is stable and extensible**: New formatting types can be added following the same pattern.

**Code location**: `renderer/app.js:1149-1223` (heavily commented for future reference)
