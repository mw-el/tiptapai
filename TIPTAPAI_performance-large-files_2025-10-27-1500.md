# TipTap AI - Performance & UX Optimization for Large Files

**Status:** üü° In Progress
**Created:** 2025-10-27 15:00
**Sprint:** Performance Optimization

---

## User Feedback Summary

Testing with a very large document (~200 pages, 25KB+ markdown) revealed several optimization opportunities:

### ‚úÖ What Works Well
- Context menu "Absatz pr√ºfen" works correctly
- Paragraph checking after edits removes green background (correct behavior)
- Green markings persist after reload (frontmatter-based system works)
- Edited paragraphs show no green background after reload (as expected)

### ‚ùå Critical Issues

#### 1. **Blocking UI During Initial Check** (Priority: HIGH)
**Problem:**
- When opening large document, entire text checking blocks user input
- Green background appears progressively, but editor is completely frozen
- User cannot edit visible text while background paragraphs are being checked

**Current Behavior:**
- Full document check runs synchronously
- UI thread blocked during LanguageTool API calls
- Check processes entire document regardless of viewport

**Impact:** Unusable for large documents

---

#### 2. **Markdown View: Wrong Focus Position** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Click markdown button ‚Üí modal shows raw markdown
- BUT: Scroll position in markdown view does not match cursor position in editor
- In long documents, user must manually scroll through entire raw markdown to find current editing position

**Current Behavior:**
- Modal shows markdown from beginning (line 1)
- No synchronization between editor cursor position and markdown view scroll

**Impact:** Very inconvenient for long documents

---

#### 3. **Green Markings Disappear on Save** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- After clicking "Speichern" (Save), green checked markings disappear
- Manual check button (üîÑ) appears non-functional afterwards
- Checking single paragraph works, but focus jumps far back to areas where green markings still exist
- After closing and reopening file, green markings are restored from frontmatter

**Current Behavior:**
- Something in save process removes checked paragraph marks from UI
- Frontmatter data remains intact (explains why reload restores marks)
- Unclear why marks disappear only from UI but not from metadata

**Investigation Needed:** Find save-related code that might clear visual marks

---

#### 4. **Dictionary Words Not Recognized After Adding** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Problem:**
- Add word to dictionary ‚Üí word stays red-underlined
- Re-checking paragraph after dictionary addition still shows word as error
- Expected: Word should not be flagged as error after dictionary addition

**Current Behavior:**
- Dictionary addition doesn't trigger immediate re-validation
- LanguageTool API might not reload dictionary
- No feedback to user that dictionary was updated

**Investigation Needed:** Check custom dictionary implementation and LanguageTool integration

---

#### 5. **Context Menu: Only First Paragraph Checked** (Priority: LOW)
**Problem:**
- Select multiple paragraphs (e.g., 3 consecutive paragraphs)
- Right-click ‚Üí "Absatz korrigieren"
- Only first paragraph gets checked, other selected paragraphs ignored

**Expected:**
- All selected paragraphs should be checked

**Current Behavior:**
- Context menu command only processes first paragraph in selection

---

### üí° Enhancement Ideas

#### A. **Background Re-Check After Correction Accepted** (Priority: LOW)
**Idea:**
- After accepting a correction, automatically re-check the paragraph
- Options:
  - Immediate re-check (might interrupt flow)
  - Delayed re-check after 5 seconds of inactivity
  - Background re-check when resources available

**Benefit:** Ensures corrections don't introduce new errors

---

#### B. **Auto-Check After 5 Seconds Inactivity** (Priority: LOW)
**Idea:**
- If user stops typing for 5 seconds, automatically check modified paragraphs
- Run in background, don't block editing

**Benefit:** Keeps document continuously validated without manual triggers

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

#### Task 1.1: Non-Blocking Background Checking
**Problem:** UI freezes during initial check of large documents

**Solution Approach:**
1. **Viewport-First Strategy:**
   - Check visible paragraphs first (immediate feedback)
   - Queue remaining paragraphs for background processing
   - Use `requestIdleCallback()` or Web Worker for background checks

2. **Progressive Checking:**
   - Split document into chunks (e.g., viewport, +2 screens up/down, rest)
   - Check viewport ‚Üí show green marks immediately
   - Check extended range ‚Üí update marks
   - Check rest ‚Üí update marks

3. **Non-Blocking API Calls:**
   - Use async/await with `setTimeout()` between chunks
   - Allow UI to remain responsive
   - Show progress indicator (e.g., "Pr√ºfe Absatz 50/200...")

**Code Changes Needed:**
- `renderer/app.js` ‚Üí `checkMultipleParagraphs()`
- Add `checkViewportFirst()` function
- Add progress UI element
- Implement chunk-based checking with delays

**Questions Before Implementation:**
- Should we show progress indicator (e.g., "Checking paragraph 50/200...")?
- Should we add preference to disable background checking?
- Should we limit background checking to X paragraphs (e.g., first 5000 words)?

---

#### Task 1.2: Markdown View Sync
**Problem:** Markdown modal doesn't scroll to cursor position

**Solution Approach:**
1. Get current cursor position in editor (line number)
2. Calculate corresponding line in raw markdown
3. Scroll markdown textarea to that line
4. Optional: Highlight current line in markdown view

**Code Changes Needed:**
- `renderer/app.js` ‚Üí Modal display logic (search for markdown modal)
- Add function to calculate line number from editor position
- Add scroll logic to textarea element

**Questions Before Implementation:**
- Should we highlight the current line in markdown view?
- Should we add two-way sync (edit in markdown ‚Üí update editor)?

---

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Fixes

#### Task 2.1: Fix Green Markings Disappearing on Save
**Investigation:**
1. Find save-related code that might clear marks
2. Check if `saveFile()` triggers document replacement
3. Verify frontmatter serialization doesn't affect marks

**Hypothesis:**
- Save might reload document content, losing visual marks
- Or: Save triggers some cleanup that removes all marks

**Code Locations to Check:**
- `renderer/app.js` ‚Üí `saveFile()`
- Check if editor content is being replaced instead of updated
- Check if marks are explicitly removed somewhere

**Questions Before Implementation:**
- Can you reproduce this issue consistently?
- Does it happen only with large files or all files?

---

#### Task 2.2: Dictionary Words Recognition
**Investigation:**
1. Check how dictionary is implemented
2. Verify LanguageTool custom dictionary file location
3. Check if LanguageTool API reloads dictionary after addition

**Possible Solutions:**
- Trigger manual re-check after dictionary addition
- Clear LanguageTool cache after dictionary update
- Restart LanguageTool server (last resort)

**Questions Before Implementation:**
- Where is the dictionary file stored?
- Is dictionary addition implemented yet?

---

#### Task 2.3: Multiple Paragraphs Context Menu
**Problem:** Only first paragraph checked when multiple selected

**Solution Approach:**
1. Get full selection range (from/to)
2. Find all paragraphs within selection
3. Check each paragraph individually
4. Show progress for multi-paragraph checks

**Code Changes Needed:**
- Context menu handler in `renderer/app.js`
- Modify paragraph collection logic to handle ranges

**Questions Before Implementation:**
- Should we show progress indicator for multiple paragraphs?
- Should we limit max number of paragraphs (e.g., 10 at once)?

---

### Phase 3: Enhancements (Priority: LOW)

#### Task 3.1: Background Re-Check After Correction
**Implementation Options:**
- **Option A:** Immediate re-check (might be disruptive)
- **Option B:** Delayed re-check after 5s inactivity (better UX)
- **Option C:** Background queue, check when idle (best performance)

**Recommended:** Option B (delayed re-check)

---

#### Task 3.2: Auto-Check After Inactivity
**Implementation:**
1. Track last edit timestamp
2. Set 5-second timer on each edit
3. When timer expires, check modified paragraphs
4. Run in background, don't block editing

**Code Changes Needed:**
- Add inactivity timer to editor update handler
- Track modified paragraphs since last check
- Implement background checking queue

## Technical Analysis

### Current LanguageTool Integration

**Files:**
- `renderer/languagetool.js` ‚Üí API client, chunking logic
- `renderer/languagetool-mark.js` ‚Üí TipTap error mark extension
- `renderer/app.js` ‚Üí Main checking logic

**Key Functions:**
- `checkText()` ‚Üí Calls LanguageTool API (with chunking for large texts)
- `checkMultipleParagraphs()` ‚Üí Checks up to N words
- `restoreCheckedParagraphs()` ‚Üí Restores green marks from frontmatter

**Current Chunking:**
- Max 50,000 chars per chunk (~25 pages)
- Sequential checking (blocks until done)

### Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Synchronous Checking:**
   - `checkMultipleParagraphs()` runs sequentially
   - No yield to UI thread between paragraphs
   - Large documents = long freeze

2. **Full Document Check on Open:**
   - Auto-checks first 2000 words on file open
   - But doesn't prioritize viewport
   - User can't edit while checking

3. **No Progress Feedback:**
   - User doesn't know checking is happening
   - Appears as frozen app
